# Credits
Well, I'm the only Developer of this mod.

# Development Status
The mod is still in development. Expect some features to be incomplete, unbalanced, and buggy. Performance issues may arise, so please keep that in mind.

I will be developing one campaign at a time. This will make development much easier and more concise. I will not break this rule unless it's necessary (e.g., refer to the previous paragraph).

I will also continue to update the mod status and provide information on mod parts that are currently in development or finished. Right now, I haven't added any in-game contents. I'm working on it!

In the meantime, you can just wait and do something else, or maybe contribute if you like. I won't rush, because taking time to develop and polish results in higher quality. Who wants a half-finished house anyway?

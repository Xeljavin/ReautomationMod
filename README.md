# Cedaruke
Welcome to Cedaruke, a Mindustry Java mod about expanding the industries into a new star system. The mod aims to introduce more new campaigns, each with their own unique features, missions, and challenges.

# Download
To download the mod, I recommend you to use either the Mod Browser (not available yet) or [Releases](https://github.com/Xeron590/Cetadustry/releases). However, if you want to play the development version, please go to [Actions](https://github.com/Xeronaus/Cedaruke/actions).

# Credits
The mod is made by Xeronaus, the only developer of this mod. Here's my discord if you want to talk with me.

# Development Status
The mod is still in development. Expect some features to be incomplete, unbalanced, and buggy. Performance issues may arise, so please keep that in mind.

I will be developing one campaign at a time. This will make development much easier and more concise. I will not break this rule unless it's necessary (e.g., refer to the previous paragraph).

I will also continue to update the mod status and provide information on mod parts that are currently in development or finished. Right now, I'm working on the in-game contents. Please be patient.

In the meantime, you can just wait and do something else. If you would like to contribute, please message me first.

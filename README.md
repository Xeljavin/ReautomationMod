# Development Status
The mod is still in development. Expect some features to be incomplete, unbalanced, and buggy. Performance issues may arise, so please keep that in mind.

I will be focusing on one campaign at a time. This will make development much easier and more concise. I will not break this rule unless it's necessary (e.g., refer to the previous paragraph).

I will also continue to update the mod status and provide information on mod parts that are currently in development or finished.

In the meantime, you can just wait and do something else, or maybe contribute if you like. I won't rush because quality is important. You wouldn't want a house without walls, right?

# Development Status

The mod is still in development. Expect some features to be incomplete, unbalanced, and buggy. Performance issues may rise so please keep that in mind.

I will be focusing on one campaign at a time. This will make development much more easier and concise. I will not break this rule unless it's necessary (e.g. refer to previous paragraph).

I will also continue to update the status and provide information on mod parts that are currently in development or finished.

In the meantime, you can just wait and do something else or maybe contribute if you like. I won't rush because quality is important, you wouldn't want a house without walls right?.
